# Simple-DMS

This is just a project I did in my free time. It is also my first projekt with WPF and my first bigger projekt overall.
It does not conform to the MVVM standarts and it's kinda janky but maybe there is a usecase for someone.
You are also welcome to fix or point out any mistakes or develop it further but please let me know first.

# Instructions
  **Settings**
The application should work with remote servers. You can specify one by just starting the application.
A window should pop up that lets you input all of the necessary details. If you want to start a mysql server on 
your computer you need to specify the location of the server. 

  **Usage**
To query a database you have to first click on a Item in the TreeView on left hand side of the UI.
You then have to click on button with the SQL picture and write your query in the textbox in the middle.
You then have to press the execute button.
